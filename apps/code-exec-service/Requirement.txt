This Service main task is to execute the code getting from the kafka Produced event from Collab_Service as : 
export const sendCodeSubmission = async (
  sessionId: string,
  userId: string,
  language: string,
  code: string
) => {
  try {
    await producer.send({
      topic: "code-submissions",
      messages: [
        {
          key: sessionId,
          value: JSON.stringify({ sessionId, userId, language, code }),
        },
      ],
    });

    console.log("Sent code submission to Kafka");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("[Collab Service] Kafka Send error", error);
  }
};


2. To execute the code I decided to make the various containers based on languages like : cpp, java, python and etc... docker containers - Using docker

3. Based on the language type triggers these containers to execute the code and Sending back the the Result of executed code to the collabService using Kafka - CorrelationI'D
